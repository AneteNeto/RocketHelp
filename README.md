## ðŸš€ Technologies:

- **[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)**
- **[Expo Bare Workflow](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/exploring-bare-workflow/)**
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**



## ðŸ“š Libraries:

- **[Expo Google Fonts](https://github.com/expo/google-fonts)**
- **[Phosphor Icons](https://github.com/duongdev/phosphor-react-native)**
- **[Native Base](https://nativebase.io/)**
- **[React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)**
- **[React Native Firebase](https://rnfirebase.io/)**
- **[React Native SVG Transformer](https://github.com/kristerkari/react-native-svg-transformer)**


## ðŸ§  Learned:

- **Expo Bare Workflow** manages the native code and also gives us access to the native Android and iOS folders
- **TypeScript** used to increase productivity and create types
- **Native Base** the componentization of the project was done using this library, which allows you to be more productive and build components with a consistent UI
- **React Native SVG Transformer** used to import svg files with the syntax of a component, a good alternative as React Native does not have standard support for svg. 

- **Firebase** to configure firebase in the expo project, some configuration is necessary as Expo Go does not have support for now, configuration is done using plugins **[NATIVE FIREBASE SDK] (https://docs.expo.dev/guides /setup-native-firebase/)** which allows you to automate the installation of dependencies in native code and then execute ```expo prebuild``` and ```expo run:android```. Authentication was used (* *Firebase Authentication**) and storage (**Firebase Cloud Firestore**)
